# ADR (Architecture Decision Records)

We record important architectural decisions in ADR format. Each ADR is a small document answering: why this choice over alternatives?

- Numbering: sequential (`ADR-0001`, `ADR-0002`, …).
- Statuses: Proposed → Accepted/Rejected → Superseded.
- Size: 0.5–1 page; include links to code/PR/docs.
- When to write: any decision impacting public contracts, architecture, or significantly altering flows/dependencies.

ADR index:
- Template: `ADR-0000-template.md`
- Add new files and update this list (bullets with short title and status).
